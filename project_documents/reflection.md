# [Squeeze and steep] Reflection

## Instructions

	@@ -18,28 +18,30 @@ presentation at the end of the unit.*

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway? I basically did everything the same from the design document mostly cause i checked the rubric beforehand for the project.

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked? 
* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How? Yes the commitments made it so i didnt go off track during the project
  I had other ideas i wanted to implement but if i did them the project wouldnt have been feasible during this time

## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?
* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time? i underestimated the work i could complete during this sprint i also learned i should just outline a plan for each sprint for now on

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship? if i start this unit over again i would like to work with a team, and doing something larger then a simple store site, i see myself trying
  to go the extra mile this project i feel i just did the bare requirements and i dont want that to further reflect me
